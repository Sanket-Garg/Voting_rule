# Voting Rules Simulation

This project provides a Python framework to simulate various voting rules and social choice mechanisms. It allows generating preference profiles for agents and selecting winners according to multiple voting systems.

Features

Generate agent preference profiles from numerical values.

Implements common voting rules:

Dictatorship

Plurality

Scoring Rule

Veto

Borda Count

Harmonic Rule

Single Transferable Vote (STV)

Range Voting

Supports tie-breaking strategies:

Max (largest alternative ID)

Min (smallest alternative ID)

Random selection

Agent-based tie-breaking

Flexible input: Can process Excel sheets or similar 2D objects for preference values.

Extensible and modular: Easy to add new voting rules or tie-breaking methods.
